*	adds ability to set a custom menu to individual pages via admin bulk edit or edit page

## Supports

* Wordpress Version: 4.7 or later
* ACF Pro version version 4,5 (at least with Nav Menu Field plugin, i'm not sure bout ACF Quick Edit Fields because their documentation game is almost as whack as mine)


## How to install (the simple way)

1.	Check and make sure the following tasks are true for a smooth install

	- [x] *Advanced Custom Fields: Nav Menu Field* plugin is **NOT** activated (or make sure it's at version 2.0.0)

	- [x] *ACF QuickEdit Fields* plugin is **NOT** activated (or make sure it's at version 3.0.1)

	- [x]	*Sidebar Menu ACF Field group* (`'group_5c366a793a9df'`), or any fields or field groups that matches the field keys in this file [ilaw-nav-field-bulk-edit-support/fields/fields.php](ilaw-nav-field-bulk-edit-support/fields/fields.php) **DO NOT** exist in the admin page/site database.


2.	Install this boi. also activate. duh.

3.	go to *Admin > iLawyer Sidebar Settings > Subdirectory Sidebars* and setup appropriate subdirectory sidebars if needed

4.	go to *Admin > Appearance > Widgets* and setup or migrate contents of blog and default sidebars into the ilawyer setup sidebars

5.	Open index.php or theme template(s) that utilize sidebars in a text editor and remove all `dynamic_sidebar($sidebar_id)` declarations and place `bulk_sidebar()` appropriately. Modify template code as needed as well (NOTE: bulk sidebar does NOT accept any arguments for now).

6.	Migrate remaining sidebar content the setup. setup subdirectory widgets or custom sidebar menus as needed


## Render sidebar

To generate sidebar call on the function `bulk_sidebar()`

This function does not accept arguments and calls on a template that goes through all possible sidebars implemented by and through this plugin
	
Example:

Suppose we edit sidebar.php or sections in your template that support widget areas, old code may look like this:

```
<aside>
	<?php if(is_home()){
		dynamic_sidebar('blog_sidebar');
	}else if(is_page(6669)){
		dynamic_sidebar('6669_sidebar');
	}else if(is_page(4)){
		dynamic_sidebar('4_sidebar');
	}else{
		dynamic_sidebar('default_sidebar');
	} ?>
</aside>
```

When the plugin is set up, it will register a widget area for pages, blogs, public cpts, and custom parent sidebars or custom menus to individual pages with the single function:

```
<aside>
	<?php bulk_sidebar(); ?>
</aside>
```

In case the rendered content needs to be customized and given options are insufficient, the function includes a boiler template: [ilaw-nav-field-bulk-edit-support/template/sidebar.php](ilaw-nav-field-bulk-edit-support/template/sidebar.php). You can replace your theme sidebar template with a copy of this plugin's instead of using `bulk_sidebar()`



## Functions aside from `bulk_sidebar`


### `has_bulk_sidebar()`

Suppose you wrapped the bulk sidebar and the container causes layout issues when the sidebar is disabled. Wrap the element wrapping your bulk sidebar to ensure it synchronnizes with the singular options

```
<?php if(has_bulk_sidebar()): ?>
	<aside>
		<?php bulk_sidebar(); ?>
	</aside>
<?php endif; ?>
```

### `bulk_get_default()`

Get default fallbacks for opts fields in case they are blank or not flushed

## Back end fields

### iLawyer Sidebar Settings

#### Settings

*	**Widget Class**

	Custom classes to add to widgets implemented and custom page sidebar menus

*	**Title Class**

	Custom classes to add to titles of widgets implemented and custom page sidebar menus

*	**Title Tag**

	html tag to be used by widgets implemented and custom page sidebar menus

*	**Default Title**

	Default title for custom page sidebar menus to default to

*	**Menu Depth**

	number of sub levels for menus. used for [`wp_nav_menu`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_nav_menu/) `depth` args

#### Subdirectory Sidebars

These fields are used to add widget areas to pages and all their descendants. This will not display if the page has its own custom menu tho

*	**Sidebar Name**

	A name for the sidebar, from this name, will be a formatted name for the register sidebar in lowercase. **Please make sure that this value is unique**

*	**Pages**

	List of pages that will default to the sidebar including its descendants

*	**Custom Post Types**

	List of CPTS that will default to the sidebar. This will only be available if the site has registered cpts.

*	**Advanced Options**

	*	Output all matching widget areas

		By default, the plugin only outputs the first sidebar from the setup that matches the page/post type. If you want to output everything and have an extra extra loooooooong sidebar then by all means.

### Page Settings

*	**Sidebar Title**

	Duh. Will default to **Default Title** if empty.
	
	Will not output if **Sidebar Menu** is not set

*	**Sidebar Menu**

	Duh.
	
	Will default to nearest ancestors set sidebar

	If that does not exist, will default to the plugin implemented sidebar instead.

	NOTE: this is not a widget area, just a humble wp_nav_menu
